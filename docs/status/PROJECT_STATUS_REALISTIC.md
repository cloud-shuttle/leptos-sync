# Leptos-Sync: Honest Project Status

## Current State: Foundation Phase (15-20% Complete)

This document provides an accurate assessment of the Leptos-Sync project status, correcting previous overstated claims.

### ✅ What's Actually Implemented

**CRDT Foundation** (Complete)
- LwwRegister and LwwMap with proper merge semantics
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Serialization/deserialization support
- Working unit-level operations

**Storage Abstraction** (Interface Only)
- Clean trait-based storage API
- Memory storage fully functional
- IndexedDB storage stubbed (delegates to memory)

**Transport Layer** (Interface Only)  
- Transport trait abstraction
- InMemory transport for development
- WebSocket transport stubbed (logs only)

**Sync Engine** (Partial)
- Message protocol definitions
- Basic peer management
- Sync/ack/presence message handling
- No actual network communication

**Collection API** (Basic)
- High-level LocalFirstCollection interface
- CRUD operations with sync hooks
- Works with memory storage only

**Demo Application** (Minimal)
- Basic console-based demonstration
- Shows CRDT operations
- No real persistence or networking

### ❌ Critical Missing Components

**Persistence Layer**
- IndexedDB implementation completely missing
- No browser storage integration
- No data durability across sessions
- No migration or versioning strategy

**Network Transport**
- WebSocket implementation is stub only
- No actual peer-to-peer communication
- No connection management
- No reconnection logic
- No error handling for network failures

**Production Features**
- No comprehensive error handling
- No performance optimization
- No security considerations
- No configuration management
- No logging/monitoring

**Testing & Quality**
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No browser compatibility testing
- No performance benchmarks

**Documentation**
- No user guides
- No API documentation
- No deployment instructions
- No troubleshooting guides

## Realistic Timeline for MVP

### Phase 1: Core Storage (2-3 weeks)
- Implement actual IndexedDB storage
- Add storage migration system
- Test browser compatibility
- Add error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 2: Network Transport (2-3 weeks)  
- Implement WebSocket transport
- Add connection management
- Implement reconnection logic
- Add peer discovery mechanisms

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (1-2 weeks)
- End-to-end integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Error handling improvements
- Demo application enhancement

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (1-2 weeks)
- Security review
- Configuration management
- Documentation
- Deployment guides

**Total Realistic Timeline: 6-10 weeks**

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Implement IndexedDB Storage**
   - Replace stub with actual IndexedDB API
   - Add proper error handling
   - Test in multiple browsers

2. **Implement WebSocket Transport**
   - Replace stub with actual WebSocket implementation
   - Add connection lifecycle management
   - Implement message queuing for offline scenarios

3. **Create Comprehensive Tests**
   - Unit tests for CRDT operations
   - Integration tests for storage + sync
   - Browser compatibility tests

4. **Build Working Demo**
   - Real-time collaborative editor
   - Persistent data across sessions
   - Multiple browser windows sync

## Current Value Proposition

The project provides a solid **foundation** with:
- Working CRDT implementations
- Clean architectural separation
- Extensible design patterns
- Compilable Rust codebase

However, it's **not ready** for:
- Production use
- Real applications  
- User testing
- Distribution

## Recommendation

Focus on implementing **one complete user journey** rather than claiming broad completeness:
1. Pick IndexedDB OR WebSocket (not both)
2. Implement fully with error handling
3. Create working demo for that specific capability
4. Test thoroughly before expanding scope

This honest assessment provides a realistic foundation for continued development.
